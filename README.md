Chlorophile
===========

The Chlorophile repository is a website work in progress.

#### Structure

 * audio : stores in-use audio files, if needed
 * css : stores in-use CSS files
 * data : Priya's playground, to store .txt, .json raw data, as text or html strings
 * design : Soujanyaa playground here, to store on-progress designs
 * doc : stores documentations and references
 * img : stores in-use images
 * js : stores in-use javascripts files

The design part being quite MB heavy, it may need a separate repository.
